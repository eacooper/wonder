Experiment:

GUI:
	-You can't record and provide feedback at the same time

	-Expected duration is based on some assumed inter-trial break duration

	-"Settings changed" warning is okay if you just changed the repeats

	-Once a new value is entered, click in another field to see the update.

	-IPDS: you can enter a subject's initials and IPD in the options ipd script to make it autoload when you click the IPD field

Other:
	-If the experiment crashes, you will need to press command+c twice(?) to get the keyboard control back




Analysis:

	-"Reprocess" button reprocesses all data. This can take a long time and the button will tell you when done. You have the close and re-open the GUI to have access to the new data. You can alternatively call load_data(1) from the terminal prompt.
