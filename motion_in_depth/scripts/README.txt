Experiment:

GUI:
-You can't record and provide feedback at the same time

-Expected duration is based on some assumed inter-trial break duration

-"Settings changed" warning is okay if you just changed the repeats

Other:
-If the experiment crashes, you will need to press command+c twice(?) to get the keyboard control back
